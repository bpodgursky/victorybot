Game mechanics
  finish resolution code to determine move success and failure 
       -- should have a workable version by monday or tuesday
Game search
  0) factor out state from configuration, so search can easily backtrack
       -- done
  1) generate all (or many) valid moves for each player

     returns map<player, set<set<order>>>
  
  2) rank moves for each player by some heuristic measure 

     returns map<player, ordered list<pair<quality, set<order>>>>

  3) for some combination of sets of orders for each player (map<player, set<order>>),
    execute moves to get updated game state

     returns BoardState, updated with those moves

  4) evaluate new state quality by some heuristic measure

  5) perform standard minimax search procedures--find a move such that it has a very few 
  possible terrible consequences
